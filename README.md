# Senitement-Bot
A **Sentiment Bot** is an AI-powered application that analyzes text to determine its **sentiment**—whether it's **positive, negative, or neutral**. It typically uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models like **Hugging Face Transformers**, **VADER**, or **TextBlob**.  

### 🔹 **How It Works**  
1. **User Input** – The bot receives text (e.g., a tweet, review, or comment).  
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleans the text (removes stopwords, punctuation, etc.).  
3. **Sentiment Analysis** – Uses a machine learning model (like BERT) to classify sentiment.  
4. **Output** – Returns sentiment score or category (e.g., Positive 😊, Negative 😠, Neutral 😐).  

### 🔹 **Use Cases**  
✅ Customer feedback analysis  
✅ Social media monitoring  
✅ Chatbots for emotional response  
✅ Market research insights
